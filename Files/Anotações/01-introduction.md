  - UBS research just confirmed that ChatGPT is the "fastest-growing consumer application in history," according to research from UBS research just announced that ChatGPT. "In 20 years following the Internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app. By comparison, **TikTok took nine months to reach 100 million monthly users**, and Instagram about 2.5 years." Other popular online services have taken longer to hit the one million user mark. Instagram being the the closest. Another comparison is when Netflix was launched as a subscription service in 1999, the one million user mark took over 3.5 years to reach this many users.
  - **Already at over one million users in just five days since launching** in November, 2002. The conversational AI bot uses AI/ML and NLP (natural Language processing)...

- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI has advanced to the point at which it's no longer necessary to prioritize computer science and coding education for the world's youth.
- Apologies to the past decade of CompSci grads, but your college years would have been better spent gaining expertise in areas like science, manufacturing or farming. Huang declared at the recent World Governments Summit in Dubai.
- "You probably recall over the course of the last 10, 15 years almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that children learn computer science," Huang explained during a talk about the future of AI. "Now, it's almost the complete opposite."

## Language model

- A probability distribution over word sequences
  - $$ P("Today is Wednesday") \approx 0.001 $$
  - $$ P("Today Wednesday is") \approx 0.0000000000001 $$
  - $$ P("The eigenvalue is positive") \approx 0.00001 $$
- Also a mechanism for "generating" text
  - $$ P("Wednesday'|"Today is") > P("blah'|"Today is") $$

## Language model

- Ideal (aka full dependence) model
  - $$ P(w*1 ... w_k) = P(w_1)P(w_2|w_1) ... P(w_k|w_1 ... w*{k-1}) $$
- **Infeasible in practice**
  - Expensive computation
  - Poor estimation (data sparsity)

## Evolution of language models

- Statistical LMs
  - (1950s-1990s)

## Tunable dependence via n-grams

- 3-gram ("trigram")
  - $$ P(w*1 ... w_k) = P(w_1)P(w_2|w_1) ... P(w_k|w*{k-2}, w\_{k-1}) $$
- 2-gram ("bigram")
  - $$ P(w*1 ... w_k) = P(w_1)P(w_2|w_1) ... P(w_k|w*{k-1}) $$
- 1-gram ("unigram")
  - $$ P(w_1 ... w_k) = P(w_1)P(w_2) ... P(w_k) $$

## Improved estimation via smoothing

- $$ P(w) $$
  - maximum likelihood estimation
  - smoothed estimation

## Evolution of language models

- Statistical LMs
  - (1950s-1990s)
- Neural LMs
  - (2013)

## Neurons

````

- Improved word-level representation
  - From sparse to distributional semantics
  - Better generalization to unseen data
- Context still lacking
  - Fixed-length input and output
  - Non-sequential representation

## Attention is (not) all you need

- **Prediction:** select best output; decode
- **Enrichment:** attend to multiple contexts; add nonlinearities
- **Preparation:** tokenize; mark position; encode


## Transformer

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[W<sub>1:t-1</sub>] --> B[Transformer]
    B --> C[Ŵ<sub>t</sub>]
```

- Effective representation
  - Can attend to entire context – no bottleneck
  - Attention heads as representation subspaces
  - Order retained via positional encoding
- Efficient processing
  - Parallelization across tokens and heads
  - Much faster training and inference
  - Scalability to massive training datasets


## Transformer architectures

- **Encoder-only**
  - (e.g. BERT (2018))
- **Encoder-decoder**
  - (e.g. T5 (2019))
- **Decoder-only**
  - (e.g. GPT (2018))
- **Decoder-only**
  - (e.g. GPT (2018))


## The power of transfer learning

## Chain-of-thought prompting

- PROMPT
  - Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
  - A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.
  - Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?
- COMPLETION
  - A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had $$ 23-20 = 3 $$. They bought 6 more apples, so they have $$ 3 + 6 = 9 $$. The answer is 9.

- Today marks the release of GPT4.5 by OpenAI. I've been looking forward to this for ~2 years, ever since GPT4 was released, because this release offers a qualitative measurement of the slope of improvement you get out of scaling pretraining compute (i.e. simply training a bigger model). Each 0.5 in the version is roughly 10X pretraining compute. Now, recall that GPT1 barely generates coherent text. GPT2 was a confused toy. GPT2.5 was "skipped" straight into GPT3, which was even more interesting. GPT3.5 crossed the threshold where it was enough to actually ship as a product and sparked OpenAI's "ChatGPT moment". And GPT4 in turn also felt better, but I'll say that it definitely felt subtle. I remember being a part of a hackathon trying to find concrete prompts where GPT4 outperformed 3.5. They definitely existed, but clear and concrete "slam dunk" examples were difficult to find. It's that ... everything was just a little bit better but in a diffuse way. The word choice was a bit more creative. Understanding of nuance in the prompt was improved. Analogies made a bit more sense. The model was a little bit funnier. World knowledge and understanding was improved at the edges of rare domains. Hallucinations were a bit less frequent. The vibes were just a bit better. It felt like the water that rises all boats, where everything gets slightly improved by 20%. So it is with that expectation that I went into testing GPT4.5, which I had access to for a few days, and which saw 10X more pretraining compute than GPT4. And I feel like, once again, I'm in the same hackathon 2 years ago. Everything is a little bit better and it's awesome, but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to. Still, it is incredible interesting and exciting as another qualitative measurement of a certain slope of capability that comes "for free" from just pretraining a bigger model. Keep in mind that that GPT4.5 was only trained with pretraining.

## The challenges of scaling

- System challenges
  - Substantial compute and energy consumption
  - Continual learning and adaptation
- Data challenges
  - Data quality and representativeness
  - Low-resource domains and languages

- Hello GPT-40
- We're announcing GPT-40, our new flagship model that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time.
- Contributions > Try on ChatGPT ➤
- All videos on this page are at 1x real time.

## Idea #2: Think first


## Learning to Reason with LLMs

- We are introducing OpenAI of, a new large language model trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. Of thinks before it answers —it can produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user.
- Contributions
  - OpenAI of ranks in the 88th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces), places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AME), and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA). While the work needed to make this new model as easy to use as current models is still ongoing, we are releasing an early version of this model, OpenAI of-preview, for immediate use in ChatGPT and to trusted API users.
  - Our large-scale reinforcement learning algorithm teaches the model how to think productively using its chain of thought in a highly data-efficient training process. We have found that the performance of of consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute). The constraints on scaling this approach differ substantially from those of LLM pretraining, and we are continuing to investigate them.

## Idea #3: Be efficient


## The efficiency challenge

- Building LLMs demands substantial resources
  - Training requires massive data and hardware
  - Fine-tuning can also be resource-intensive
- Deploying LLMs is also expensive
  - Inference (using the model) can be slow and costly
  - Limited accessibility due to high computational costs
