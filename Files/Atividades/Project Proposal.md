# Project Proposal Guidelines: LLM Course

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for crafting a successful project proposal for the Large Language Models (LLM) course. A well-structured proposal is crucial for outlining your project's scope, methodology, and expected contributions.

## I. Introduction and Overview

### A. Purpose of the Proposal

The project proposal serves as a foundational document for your final project. It is designed to:

- Clearly articulate your project idea.
- Demonstrate your understanding of relevant LLM concepts.
- Outline a feasible plan for execution within the course timeline.
- Enable instructors to provide constructive feedback and guidance.

### B. Audience

Your proposal will be reviewed by the course instructors. It should be clear, concise, and technically sound, demonstrating a graduate-level understanding of the subject matter.

## II. Proposal Structure and Content

Your project proposal should include the following sections:

### A. Project Title

Choose a descriptive and concise title that accurately reflects your project's focus.

### B. Team Members

List all team members, including their full names and student IDs. If you are sharing the project with another class, please state so here.

### C. Abstract/Executive Summary

Provide a brief, compelling summary (150-250 words) of your project. This should include:

- The problem you aim to address.
- Your proposed solution or approach.
- The key objectives of your project.
- Expected outcomes or contributions.

### D. Introduction and Motivation

- **Background:** Briefly introduce the relevant LLM concepts and existing work related to your project.
- **Problem Statement:** Clearly define the specific problem or research question your project will address. Explain why this problem is significant in the context of LLMs.
- **Motivation:** Discuss why this project is important to you and the potential impact it could have.

### E. Project Objectives

List clear, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives for your project. These objectives should directly address your problem statement.

### F. Proposed Methodology

This is a critical section. Detail how you plan to achieve your project objectives.

- **Data Collection/Preparation:** Describe the datasets you plan to use, how you will acquire them, and any preprocessing steps.
- **Model/Architecture Selection:** Discuss the specific LLM models or architectures you intend to use or develop. Justify your choices.
- **Implementation Details:** Outline the tools, frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), and libraries you will utilize. Describe your development environment.
- **Experimental Design:** If applicable, describe how you will design experiments to evaluate your solution. Specify metrics for evaluation.
- **Evaluation Plan:** Detail how you will assess the success of your project in relation to your objectives.

### G. Expected Outcomes and Contributions

- What are the tangible deliverables you expect from this project (e.g., a functional LLM application, a comparative analysis report, a novel prompt engineering technique)?
- What new knowledge or insights do you anticipate contributing to the field of LLMs or a specific application area?

### H. Timeline and Milestones

Provide a realistic timeline for your project, breaking it down into key milestones. Use a table format for clarity.

| Milestone            | Expected Completion Date | Deliverable                  |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Literature Review    | [ ] Date                 | Summary of relevant papers   |
| Data Preparation     | [ ] Date                 | Cleaned dataset              |
| Model Implementation | [ ] Date                 | Initial code and basic model |
| Experimentation      | [ ] Date                 | Preliminary results          |
| Report Draft         | [ ] Date                 | First draft of the report    |
| Final Submission     | [ ] Date                 | [ ] File                     |

### I. Resources and References

- List any external resources (e.g., specific papers, GitHub repositories, datasets) you plan to utilize.
- Cite all sources using a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, IEEE).

### J. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

Anticipate potential challenges or risks (e.g., data availability, computational resources, model convergence) and propose strategies to mitigate them.

## III. Submission Details

### A. Format

- Proposals should be submitted as a PDF document.
- Use [NeurIPS][LinkNeurIPS] format.
- Maintain clear headings and subheadings for readability.
- Page limit: 2-3 pages (excluding references).

### B. Due Date

The project proposal is due on **Oct 2, 2025**. Please submit it via Moodle.

## IV. Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

- Clarity and completeness of the proposal.
- Feasibility of the proposed project.
- Relevance to LLM course topics.
- Originality and potential impact.
- Technical soundness of the proposed methodology.

## V. Support and Resources

- **Instructor Office Hours:** Feel free to discuss your project ideas during office hours.
- **Course Discussion Forum:** Utilize the Moodle discussion forum for questions and to seek feedback from peers.

We look forward to reviewing your innovative project proposals.
